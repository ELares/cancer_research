"""What the simulation figures DRAW, checked against the committed fixtures.

`tests/test_quantitative_figure_data.py` guards these figures' CAPTIONS against
`tests/fixtures/*.json`, and `test_flagship_figure_data.py` does the same for
fig27's. Neither opens a PDF. So the caption could be right and the figure
wrong -- which is exactly what happened to fig17 in #790, where the panels came
from one simulation scenario and the numbers printed on them from another, and
every caption guard passed.

These figures read `simulations/output/`, which is gitignored, so CI cannot
regenerate them (#788). But it does not have to: the numbers they draw are
already committed as fixtures for the caption guards, so comparing the two
gates the artifact a reader actually looks at, in CI, with no new data and
without tracking simulation output.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It cannot notice a figure whose PLOT is wrong while its
annotations are right -- a mis-drawn curve, a swapped panel, a wrong colour
map. It compares the numbers rendered as text. That is a smaller claim than
"the figure is correct", and it is the claim the committed data can support.

BINDING IS POSITIONAL where the artifact gives no alternative. A matplotlib bar
annotation carries no label in the text stream, so for fig24 and fig25's panel
(a) the order is the bar order, documented per figure below. Where labels ARE
adjacent -- fig25's panel (b) -- each value is bound to its own label, because
a set comparison passes when two values are swapped between subjects, which is
the defect the fig17 guard was fixed for.
